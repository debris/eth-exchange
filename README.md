## Prerequisites

* node
* npm
* mongodb
* cpp-ethereum

## Installation


### Addendum for ArchLinux
Make sure you have node.js and mongodb. You can get them via pacman with
```sudo pacman -S nodejs mongodb```

If you are getting problems at `npm install` due to `gyp` then use:
```npm config set python /usr/bin/python2.7 -g```

This way npm (and gyp) will know which version of python to use and not use python 3
which is the ArchLinux default.

git clone https://github.com/debris/eth-exchange
